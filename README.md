This is a tool to view hosts for my home server/lab.  

The goal is to see what virtual machines, devices and self hosted services I have running from a dashboard across vlans. I segmented my home network for testing, developing and trying things out. Monitoring cloud resources I have as well.

I used:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React Framework
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - Component Library
